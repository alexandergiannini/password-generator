# Refactored Password Generator by Alexander Giannini

# Hello there! My name is Alex Giannini and this is my password generator. I was given starter code, which I refactored and developed further more. Basically, the user would decide what their password length would be, and if they wanted to include different types of text characters including lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. After taking in that information, a password would be generated based on their selected criteria. Hope you enjoy, thanks!
